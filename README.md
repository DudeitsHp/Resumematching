# **Resume matching with job description**

A resume keyword scanner is a piece of software that job posting sites use to search for certain keywords in resumes and organize applications based on the findings. For a recruiting manager to assess, it then connects eligible candidates to openings. Its criteria are established by the recruiters and organizations looking for candidates. This system is also known as an application tracking system (ATS).

For submission to websites that make use of applicant tracking software, online resumes should be optimized. A generic resume will not be as effective as one that has been tailored to use ATS. You should discover methods to naturally add ATS keywords into your application because your resume must be simple to read for actual people.
