# ResuMatch: A Resume Matching Python Project with Gradio Front-End

Welcome to the ResuMatch GitHub repository! This project is a Python-based solution that leverages Gradio for creating a user-friendly front-end interface for resume matching. ResuMatch aims to streamline the process of connecting job seekers with suitable employment opportunities by matching their resumes with job descriptions.

## Project Overview

ResuMatch consists of the following key components:

- **Gradio Front-End:** An intuitive user interface powered by Gradio, allowing users to upload their resumes and job descriptions seamlessly.
- **Resume Matching Engine:** A Python backend that utilizes techniques such as text processing, vectorization, and cosine similarity to match resumes with job descriptions.
- **Data Preparation and Cleansing:** Preprocessing of both resumes and job descriptions to ensure accurate matching and relevant results.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Displaying matched results and similarity scores for a more transparent understanding of the match quality.
